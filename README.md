# hello-world

This is my github that I plan to upload all of my works of arts for people to see.
If I use github enough and begin to like it, then I may use it to manage all of
my future projects as well.  Right now, I'm using OneDrive and it feels like it's
lacking some.

This Hello World repository is where I test out my git functionality in new IDEs.
